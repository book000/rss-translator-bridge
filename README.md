# RSS Translator Bridge

A Fastify server that translates RSS feeds.
It fetches a feed, translates its text in batches through a Google Apps Script (GAS) translation API, and returns the result as RSS 2.0 XML.
It also serves a small web UI that shows the original and translated XML.

## Features

- Batch translation: all texts of a feed are sent to GAS in one request.
- Fallback: when a translation fails, the original text is kept.
- HTML-aware: every text is sent to GAS with `mode: "html"`, so markup in `content:encoded`, `description` and similar fields is handled as HTML.
- Caching: translations are cached in memory, and translated responses carry a CDN-oriented `Cache-Control` header.
- SSRF protection: only public `http:`/`https:` destinations are fetched (see [Fetch restrictions](#fetch-restrictions)).
- Serverless: runs on Vercel through `api/serverless.ts`, and as a plain Node.js server through `src/index.ts`.

## Usage

Start the server (see [Development](#development)) and request `/api`:

```
GET /api?url=<feed URL>&sourceLang=<code>&targetLang=<code>
```

For example, to translate an English feed into Japanese:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ffeed.xml&sourceLang=en&targetLang=ja'
```

Opening `/` in a browser shows the web UI instead (`public/`), which calls `/api` and `/api/proxy`.

### Query parameters

| Parameter          | Required | Description                                                                 | Default                                |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `url`              | Yes      | URL of the feed to translate. Must be given once.                           | -                                      |
| `sourceLang`       | No       | Source language code                                                        | `DEFAULT_SOURCE_LANG` (`auto`)         |
| `targetLang`       | No       | Target language code                                                        | `DEFAULT_TARGET_LANG` (`ja`)           |
| `excludeFeedTitle` | No       | `true` keeps the feed title untranslated. Any other value translates it.    | `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_FEED_TITLE` (`true`)  |
| `excludeItemTitle` | No       | `true` keeps the item titles untranslated. Any other value translates them. | `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_ITEM_TITLE` (`false`) |

Language codes are passed to the GAS API unchanged, so the supported values depend on the GAS script.
The web UI offers `en`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh`, `es`, `fr` and `de`, plus `auto` for the source language.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js (`engines` requires 18 or later; `.node-version` pins the version used for development)
- pnpm (enforced by a `preinstall` script)
- A deployed Google Apps Script translation API (see [GAS API contract](#gas-api-contract))

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # set GAS_URL
pnpm dev               # tsx watch
```

`pnpm start` runs the server once without watching.
The server reads its settings from environment variables only; it does not load `.env` by itself, so export the variables in your shell before starting it, for example `set -a; source .env; set +a`.

| `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_ITEM_TITLE`       | No       | Default for `excludeItemTitle`. Only `true` enables it.               | `false`    |
| `TRANSLATION_CACHE_ENABLED`        | No       | Enable the translation cache. Only `false` disables it.               | `true`     |
| `TRANSLATION_CACHE_TTL_MS`         | No       | Translation cache TTL in milliseconds                                 | `21600000` |

The translation cache is per process.
Cached entries are keyed by the language pair and a SHA-256 hash of the text.

When the CDN cache is enabled, `/api` success responses carry `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, s-maxage=<S_MAXAGE>, stale-while-revalidate=<STALE_WHILE_REVALIDATE>`; when disabled they carry `no-store`.
`/api/proxy` sets no `Cache-Control` header.

## API

### `GET /api`

Translates a feed and returns RSS 2.0 XML (`Content-Type: application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8`).

The output contains `title`, `link`, `description`, `language` and `lastBuildDate` for the channel, and `title`, `link`, `description`, `pubDate` and `guid` for each item.
`content:encoded` and `dc:creator` are added to an item only when the source has them.
Item bodies are taken from the first available of `content:encoded`, `content`, `description` and `summary`, and are translated in place.
All items are translated; there is no item limit.

Errors are returned as JSON:

```json
{ "status": "error", "error": "URL parameter is required" }
```

### `GET /api/proxy?url=<feed URL>`

Returns the original, untranslated feed body with `Content-Type: application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8`.
The web UI uses it to show the original feed without hitting CORS restrictions.
Errors are returned as `{ "error": "<message>" }`.
When the upstream responds with a non-2xx status, that status is returned with `Failed to fetch RSS: <status text>`.

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }
```

### Error statuses

Both `/api` and `/api/proxy` map fetch errors to the following statuses:

| Status | Condition                                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `url` is missing or given more than once, or the destination is rejected (scheme, credentials, address) |
| 502    | The response exceeds the size limit, or a redirect has no `Location` or exceeds the redirect limit      |
| 504    | The fetch exceeds the 5 second deadline                                                                 |
| 500    | Any other fetch or parse failure (translation failures fall back to the original text)                  |

### Fetch restrictions

Every URL is fetched through `src/safe-fetch.ts`, which applies the following to the first request and to each redirect target:

- Only `http:` and `https:` are allowed, and URLs with credentials (`http://user:pass@host/`) are rejected.
- Connections to loopback, private, link-local and other internal addresses are rejected.
  The check runs on the addresses actually used for the connection, and a hostname is rejected if any of its addresses is internal.
- At most 5 redirects are followed.
- DNS resolution, redirects and body download share a 5 second deadline.
- The decompressed response may be at most 5 MiB.
- No headers from the caller (such as `Cookie` or `Authorization`) are forwarded.

## GAS API contract

The server POSTs JSON to `GAS_URL`.
The request and response types are defined in `src/types.ts`.

Batch request (used by `/api`; timeout of at most 25 seconds, see [Deployment](#deployment)):

```json
{
  "batch": true,
  "before": "en",
  "after": "ja",
  "texts": [{ "id": "feed-description", "text": "..." }],
  "mode": "html"
}
```

Batch response:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "feed-description",
      "original": "...",
      "translated": "...",
      "success": true
    }
  ],
  "processed": 1,
  "total": 1,
  "executionTime": 120
}
```

Items with `success: false` fall back to their original text.
If the request fails entirely (network error, timeout, non-2xx), every pending item falls back to its original text and `/api` still returns the feed.

## Deployment

The repository is set up for Vercel: `vercel.json` routes every path to `api/serverless.ts` and sets `maxDuration` to 30 seconds.
Set `GAS_URL` (and any other variables) in the Vercel project settings, then deploy with the Vercel CLI (`vercel`).
Fetching, parsing and translating a feed share a 27 second budget, which leaves 3 seconds of the 30 second limit for building and sending the response.
The GAS batch timeout is the smaller of 25 seconds and the budget left after the feed fetch, and it also covers reading the response body.
A very large feed whose translation does not finish in time is still returned, with the untranslated items in their original text.

The in-memory translation cache only lives as long as a function instance.

## Tests

Jest with ts-jest; tests are in `src/__tests__/`.
External dependencies (the GAS `fetch` call, `rss-parser`, `safeFetchText`) are mocked.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint and tests through a reusable workflow from `book000/templates`.
